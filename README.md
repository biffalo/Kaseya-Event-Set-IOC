# Kaseya-Event-Set-IOC
Event set to be used with Kaseya VSA to catch sketchy happenings

This works if you have sysmon deployed to your kaseya agents. Event set is what I use internally and gets updated semiregularly.

Entries are process names/commands/hashes of known ATP/Ransomware operatorions. YMMV.
